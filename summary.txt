Applications of Speech Synthesis The application of synthetic speech is expanding fast whilst the quality of TTS systems is also increasing steadily. Speech synthesis systems are also becoming more affordable for common customers, making these systems suitable for everyday use. Applications for the Blind. Applications for the Deafened and Vocally Handicapped 3. Applications for Telecommunications and Multimedia Nwakanma Ifeanyi,IJRIT 156 IJRIT International Journal of Research in Informat ion Technology, Volume 2, Issue 5, May 2014, Pg: 154 163 5. The new system has a reasoning process. The new system can do text structuring and annotation. The new system 's speech rate can be adjusted.
